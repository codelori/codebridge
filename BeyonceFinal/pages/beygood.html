        <p class="beyGoodBody">The BeyGOOD team is still moving throughout South Africa, connecting 
            with organizations that are working to change their communities now and forever. Lalela 
            is an educational art program for at-risk youth, that teaches children how to map and 
            manifest their dreams and goals. Lalela began in Capetown in 2010. The team stopped by 
            the Johannesburg location, Lalela’s Centre of Arts and Innovation.By igniting 
            imagination, Lalela connects the arts to everything in a child’s life, starting as 
            early as 6 years old. They encourage creative thinking and solutions, ultimately 
            equipping students with the tools they need to thrive in their communities. Learn more 
            about Lalela here: https://www.lalela.org</p>

            <p class="beyGoodBody">We visited IkamvaYouth in Milpark, Johannesburg to see their 
                organization in action. IkamvaYouth provides after-school tutoring and support to 
                disadvantaged youth in hopes of pulling them out of poverty and into education, and 
                ultimately, employment. Founded in 2003, its programming was created by both learners 
                and tutors, offering a range of services including academic tutoring, psycho-social 
                support, and career guidance. IkamvaYouth's model is simple: youth-driven, low-cost 
                and high impact programming. Today, IkamvaYouth has over fifteen branches and 5,000 
                earners each year. During our visit we met tutors and students who are committed to 
                the program and all it has to offer. See more from our visit below.</p>
