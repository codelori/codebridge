                    <p class="aboutText">Born in Houston, Texas, Beyoncé Knowles 
                        first captured the public's eye as lead vocalist of the 
                        R&B group Destiny's Child. She later established a solo 
                        career with her debut album Dangerously in Love, becoming 
                        one of music's top-selling artists with sold-out tours 
                        and a slew of awards. Knowles has also starred in several 
                        films, including Dream Girls. She married hip-hop recording 
                        artist Jay-Z in 2008. In late 2013, she surprised audiences 
                        by releasing her fifth studio album, self-titled Beyoncé, 
                        and has twice performed at the Super Bowl. She released her 
                        sixth studio album, Lemonade, after the airing of an HBO 
                        special in April 2016, and two years later she dropped a 
                        joint album with Jay-Z, Everything Is Love, while the two 
                        were on tour.</p>

                    <p class="aboutText">Singer and actress Beyoncé Giselle Knowles 
                        was born on September 4, 1981, in Houston, Texas. She started 
                        singing at an early age, competing in local talent shows and 
                        winning many of these events by impressing audiences with her 
                        singing and dancing abilities. Beyoncé Giselle Knowles was born 
                        in Houston, Texas, to Celestine "Tina" Knowles (née Beyincé), 
                        a hairdresser and salon owner, and Mathew Knowles, a Xerox sales 
                        manager. Beyoncé's name is a tribute to her mother's maiden name.
                        Beyoncé's younger sister Solange is also a singer and a former 
                        backup dancer for Destiny's Child.</p>

                    <p class="aboutText">Teaming up with her cousin, Kelly Rowland, 
                        and two classmates, Beyoncé formed an all-female singing group. 
                        Her father, Matthew Knowles, served as the band's manager. Destiny's Child soon 
                        became one of the most popular R&B acts, with the release of their 
                        first, self-titled album. Gaining momentum, the group scored its 
                        first No. 1 single on the pop charts with "Bills, Bills, Bills," 
                        off their second album. The recording also featured another smash 
                        hit, "Say My Name." <br> While enjoying her group's success, Beyoncé 
                        began exploring other projects.</p>

                    <p class="aboutText">On the musical front, Beyoncé took center stage as a solo 
                        artist, releasing her first album, Dangerously in Love, in 2003. The recording 
                        became a huge success for her both commercially and critically. It sold 
                        millions of copies and won five Grammy Awards. Destiny's Child released 
                        their last studio album, Destiny Fulfilled, in 2004, and officially broke 
                        up the following year. </br> On her own, Beyoncé continued to enjoy great 
                        success. Her second studio album, 2006's B'Day featured such hits as 
                        "Irreplaceable" and "Deja Vu." On the big screen, she starred opposite Jennifer 
                        Hudson, Jaime Foxx and Eddie Murphy in Dreamgirls. The film was adapted from 
                        the hit Broadway musical of the same name.</p>

                        small, private ceremony in New York City. Among the guests sighted at the 
                        wedding were Beyoncé's mother, Tina Knowles; her father and manager, Matthew;

                        and friend Gwyneth Paltrow.</br>The newlywed continued to work as hard as ever, 
                        promoting her latest effort, I am ... Sasha Fierce (2008). Beyoncé scored two 
                        big hits off the album—"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" and "If I Were a Boy."

                        honors—the most wins in a single night by a female artist. Her record was 
                        matched two years later by pop/soul artist Adele. In 2010, she also tied the 
                        record for most No. 1 hits on Billboard’s Pop Songs chart, which is based 
                        on radio airplay. In 2011, she made the Forbes Top 10 list of entertainment's 
                        highest-earning women. By 2013, Beyoncé had won 16 Grammys.</p>

                        pregnancy, Beyoncé took the stage for an eagerly anticipated performance at 
                        the April 2018 music festival. The first black woman to headline the event, 
                        Beyoncé wowed attendees and critics alike with her top-shelf singing and 
                        choreography, delivering favorites like "Crazy In Love" and a rendition of 
                        the civil rights anthem "Lift Every Voice and Sing." She was also joined 
                        during the two-hour set by hubby Jay-Z, sister Solange and her old Destiny's 
                        Child cohorts, Rowland and Williams.</p>
